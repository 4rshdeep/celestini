## Todo

* [x] Get a coffee.
* [x] Dataset Preparation
  *  Create N (N=50) cryptograms(plain text + encrypted text) using simple substitution and vigenere cipher.
* [ ] Identify features that can be used as an input to neural network
  * Index of Coincidence, Frequency analysis(helpful in substitution cipher), and more. (Repeated Number of Adjacent Duplicates?, Minimum Number of Characters?)
* [ ] Make a neural network, think number of hidden layer/parameters.

* [ ] Loss, metric which can be used? Binary classification problem

* [ ] Plot results. Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix.
