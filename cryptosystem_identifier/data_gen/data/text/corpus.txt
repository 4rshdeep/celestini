IT IS TIME I TRIED ANOTHER HAWK DAVOS A RED HAWKTHEONTHERE WAS NO SAFE ANCHORAGE AT PYKE BUT THEON GREYJOY WISHED TO LOOK ON HIS FATHERS CASTLE FROM THE SEA TO SEE IT AS HE HAD SEEN IT LAST TEN YEARS BEFORE WHEN ROBERT BARATHEONS WAR GALLEY HAD BORNE HIM AWAY TO BE A WARD OF EDDARD STARK ON THAT DAY HE HAD STOOD BESIDE THE RAIL LISTENING TO THE STROKE OF THE OARS AND THE POUNDING OF THE MASTERS DRUM WHILE HE WATCHED PYKE DWINDLE IN THE DISTANCE NOW HE WANTED TO SEE IT GROW LARGER TO RISE FROM THE SEA BEFORE HIMOBEDIENT TO HIS WISHES THE MYRAHAM BEAT HER WAY PAST THE POINT WITH HER SAILS SNAPPING AND HER CAPTAIN CURSING THE WIND AND HIS CREW AND THE FOLLIES OF HIGHBORN LORDLINGS THEON DREW THE HOOD OF HIS CLOAK UP AGAINST THE SPRAY AND LOOKED FOR HOMETHE SHORE WAS ALL SHARP ROCKS AND GLOWERING CLIFFS AND THE CASTLE SEEMED ONE WITH THE REST ITS TOWERS AND WALLS AND BRIDGES QUARRIED FROM THE SAME GREYBLACK STONE WET BY THE SAME SALT WAVES FESTOONED WITH THE SAME SPREADING PATCHES OF DARK GREEN LICHEN SPECKLED BY THE DROPPINGS OF THE SAME SEABIRDS THE POINT OF LAND ON WHICH THE GREYJOYS HAD RAISED THEIR FORTRESS HAD ONCE THRUST LIKE A SWORD INTO THE BOWELS OF THE OCEAN BUT THE WAVES HAD HAMMERED AT IT DAY AND NIGHT UNTIL THE LAND BROKE AND SHATTERED THOUSANDS OF YEARS PAST ALL THAT REMAINED WERE THREE BARE AND BARREN ISLANDS AND A DOZEN TOWERING STACKS OF ROCK THAT ROSE FROM THE WATER LIKE THE PILLARS OF SOME SEA GODS TEMPLE WHILE THE ANGRY WAVES FOAMED AND CRASHED AMONG THEMDREAR DARK FORBIDDING PYKE STOOD ATOP THOSE ISLANDS AND PILLARS ALMOST A PART OF THEM ITS CURTAIN WALL CLOSING OFF THE HEADLAND AROUND THE FOOT OF THE GREAT STONE BRIDGE THAT LEAPT FROM THE CLIFFTOP TO THE LARGEST ISLET DOMINATED BY THE MASSIVE BULK OF THE GREAT KEEP FARTHER OUT WERE THE KITCHEN KEEP AND THE BLOODY KEEP EACH ON ITS OWN ISLAND TOWERS AND OUTBUILDINGS CLUNG TO THE STACKS BEYOND LINKED TO EACH OTHER BY COVERED ARCHWAYS WHEN THE PILLARS STOOD CLOSE BY LONG SWAYING WALKS OF WOOD AND ROPE WHEN THEY DID NOTTHE SEA TOWER ROSE FROM THE OUTMOST ISLAND AT THE POINT OF THE BROKEN SWORD THE OLDEST PART OF THE CASTLE ROUND AND TALL THE SHEERSIDED PILLAR ON WHICH IT STOOD HALFEATEN THROUGH BY THE ENDLESS BATTERING OF THE WAVES THE BASE OF THE TOWER WAS WHITE FROM CENTURIES OF SALT SPRAY THE UPPER STORIES GREEN FROM THE LICHEN THAT CRAWLED OVER IT LIKE A THICK BLANKET THE JAGGED CROWN BLACK WITH SOOT FROM ITS NIGHTLY WATCHFIREABOVE THE SEA TOWER SNAPPED HIS FATHERS BANNER THE MYRAHAM WAS TOO FAR OFF FOR THEON TO SEE MORE THAN THE CLOTH ITSELF BUT HE KNEW THE DEVICE IT BORE THE GOLDEN KRAKEN OF HOUSE GREYJOY ARMS WRITHING AND REACHING AGAINST A BLACK FIELD THE BANNER STREAMED FROM AN IRON MAST SHIVERING AND TWISTING AS THE WIND GUSTED LIKE A BIRD STRUGGLING TO TAKE FLIGHT AND HERE AT LEAST THE DIREWOLF OF STARK DID NOT FLY ABOVE CASTING ITS SHADOW DOWN UPON THE GREYJOY KRAKENTHEON HAD NEVER SEEN A MORE STIRRING SIGHT IN THE SKY BEHIND THE CASTLE THE FINE RED TAIL OF THE COMET WAS VISIBLE THROUGH THIN SCUTTLING CLOUDS ALL THE WAY FROM RIVERRUN TO SEAGARD THE MALLISTERS HAD ARGUED ABOUT ITS MEANING IT IS MY COMET THEON TOLD HIMSELF SLIDING A HAND INTO HIS FURLINED CLOAK TO TOUCH THE OILSKIN POUCH SNUG IN ITS POCKET INSIDE WAS THE LETTER ROBB STARK HAD GIVEN HIM PAPER AS GOOD AS A CROWNDOES THE CASTLE LOOK AS YOU REMEMBER IT MILORD THE CAPTAINS DAUGHTER ASKED AS SHE PRESSED HERSELF AGAINST HIS ARMIT LOOKS SMALLER THEON CONFESSED THOUGH PERHAPS THAT IS ONLY THE DISTANCE THE MYRAHAM WAS A FATBELLIED SOUTHRON MERCHANTER UP FROM OLDTOWN CARRYING WINE AND CLOTH AND SEED TO TRADE FOR IRON ORE HER CAPTAIN WAS A FATBELLIED SOUTHRON MERCHANTER AS WELL AND THE STONY SEA THAT FOAMED AT THE FEET OF THE CASTLE MADE HIS PLUMP LIPS QUIVER SO HE STAYED WELL OUT FARTHER THAN THEON WOULD HAVE LIKED AN IRONBORN CAPTAIN IN A LONGSHIP WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM ALONG THE CLIFFS AND UNDER THE HIGH BRIDGE THAT SPANNED THE GAP BETWEEN THE GATEHOUSE AND THE GREAT KEEP BUT THIS PLUMP OLDTOWNER HAD NEITHER THE CRAFT THE CREW NOR THE COURAGE TO ATTEMPT SUCH A THING SO THEY SAILED PAST AT A SAFE DISTANCE AND THEON MUST CONTENT HIMSELF WITH SEEING PYKE FROM AFAR EVEN SO THE MYRAHAM HAD TO STRUGGLE MIGHTILY TO KEEP ITSELF OFF THOSE ROCKSIT MUST BE WINDY THERE THE CAPTAINS DAUGHTER OBSERVEDHE LAUGHED WINDY AND COLD AND DAMP A MISERABLE HARD PLACE IN TRUTH BUT MY LORD FATHER ONCE TOLD ME THAT HARD PLACES BREED HARD MEN AND HARD MEN RULE THE WORLDTHE CAPTAINS FACE WAS AS GREEN AS THE SEA WHEN HE CAME BOWING UP TO THEON AND ASKED MAY WE MAKE FOR PORT NOW MILORDYOU MAY THEON SAID A FAINT SMILE PLAYING ABOUT HIS LIPS THE PROMISE OF GOLD HAD TURNED THE OLDTOWNER INTO A SHAMELESS LICKSPITTLE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH DIFFERENT VOYAGE IF A LONGSHIP FROM THE ISLANDS HAD BEEN WAITING AT SEAGARD AS HED HOPED IRONBORN CAPTAINS WERE PROUD AND WILLFUL AND DID NOT GO IN AWE OF A MANS BLOOD THE ISLANDS WERE TOO SMALL FOR AWE AND A LONGSHIP SMALLER STILL IF EVERY CAPTAIN WAS A KING ABOARD HIS OWN SHIP AS WAS OFTEN SAID IT WAS SMALL WONDER THEY NAMED THE ISLANDS THE LAND OF TEN THOUSAND KINGS AND WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN YOUR KINGS SHIT OVER THE RAIL AND TURN GREEN IN A STORM IT WAS HARD TO BEND THE KNEE AND PRETEND THEY WERE GODS THE DROWNED GOD MAKES MEN OLD KING URRON REDHAND HAD ONCE SAID THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO BUT ITS MEN WHO MAKE CROWNSA LONGSHIP WOULD HAVE MADE THE CROSSING IN HALF THE TIME AS WELL THE MYRAHAM WAS A WALLOWING TUB IF TRUTH BE TOLD AND HE WOULD NOT CARE TO BE ABOARD HER IN A STORM STILL THEON COULD NOT BE TOO UNHAPPY HE WAS

AS OATMEAL BUT HER BREASTS FILLED HIS HANDS NICELY AND SHE HAD BEEN A MAIDEN THE FIRST TIME HE TOOK HER THAT WAS SURPRISING AT HER AGE BUT THEON FOUND IT DIVERTING HE DID NOT THINK THE CAPTAIN APPROVED AND THAT WAS AMUSING AS WELL WATCHING THE MAN STRUGGLE TO SWALLOW HIS OUTRAGE WHILE PERFORMING HIS COURTESIES TO THE HIGH LORD THE RICH PURSE OF GOLD HED BEEN PROMISED NEVER FAR FROM HIS THOUGHTSAS THEON SHRUGGED OUT OF HIS WET CLOAK THE GIRL SAID YOU MUST BE SO HAPPY TO SEE YOUR HOME AGAIN MILORD HOW MANY YEARS HAVE YOU BEEN AWAYTEN OR CLOSE AS MAKES NO MATTER HE TOLD HER I WAS A BOY

THATCHED ROOFS JUST BEYOND THE HEDGE SHE CREPT ALONG UNTIL SHE FOUND A GAP AND SQUIRMED THROUGH ON HER BELLY KEEPING WELL HIDDEN UNTIL SHE SAW WHAT MADE THE SMELLBESIDE THE GENTLY LAPPING WATERS OF GODS EYE A LONG GIBBET OF RAW GREEN WOOD HAD BEEN THROWN UP AND THINGS THAT HAD ONCE BEEN MEN DANGLED THERE THEIR FEET IN CHAINS WHILE CROWS PECKED AT THEIR FLESH AND FLAPPED FROM CORPSE TO CORPSE FOR EVERY CROW THERE WERE A HUNDRED FLIES WHEN THE WIND BLEW OFF THE LAKE THE NEAREST CORPSE TWISTED ON ITS CHAIN EVER SO SLIGHTLY THE CROWS HAD EATEN MOST OF ITS FACE AND SOMETHING ELSE HAD BEEN AT IT AS WELL SOMETHING MUCH LARGER THROAT AND CHEST HAD BEEN TORN APART AND GLISTENING GREEN ENTRAILS AND RIBBONS OF RAGGED FLESH DANGLED FROM WHERE THE BELLY HAD BEEN OPENED ONE ARM HAD BEEN RIPPED RIGHT OFF THE SHOULDER ARYA SAW THE BONES A FEW FEET AWAY GNAWED AND CRACKED PICKED CLEAN OF MEATSHE MADE HERSELF LOOK AT THE NEXT MAN AND THE ONE BEYOND HIM AND THE ONE BEYOND HIM TELLING HERSELF SHE WAS HARD

A SHOUTTHE TWO SPEARMEN TURNED AT THE CRY AND A THIRD MAN CAME INTO VIEW SHOVING A CAPTIVE BEFORE HIM IT WAS GROWING TOO DARK TO MAKE OUT FACES BUT THE PRISONER WAS WEARING A SHINY STEEL HELM AND WHEN ARYA SAW THE HORNS SHE KNEW IT WAS GENDRY YOU STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID SHE THOUGHT IF HED BEEN HERE SHE WOULD HAVE KICKED HIM AGAINTHE GUARDS WERE TALKING LOUDLY BUT SHE WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO MAKE OUT THE WORDS ESPECIALLY WITH THE CROWS GABBLING AND FLAPPING CLOSER TO HAND ONE OF THE SPEARMEN SNATCHED THE HELM OFF GENDRYS HEAD AND ASKED HIM A QUESTION BUT HE MUST NOT HAVE LIKED THE ANSWER BECAUSE HE SMASHED HIM ACROSS THE FACE WITH THE BUTT OF HIS SPEAR AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN THE ONE WHOD CAPTURED HIM GAVE HIM A KICK WHILE THE SECOND SPEARMAN WAS TRYING ON THE BULLSHEAD HELM FINALLY THEY PULLED HIM TO HIS FEET AND MARCHED HIM OFF TOWARD THE STOREHOUSE WHEN THEY OPENED THE HEAVY WOODEN DOORS A SMALL BOY DARTED OUT BUT ONE OF THE GUARDS GRABBED HIS ARM AND FLUNG HIM BACK INSIDE ARYA HEARD SOBBING FROM INSIDE THE BUILDING AND THEN A SHRIEK SO LOUD AND FULL OF PAIN THAT IT MADE HER BITE HER LIPTHE GUARDS SHOVED GENDRY INSIDE WITH THE BOY AND BARRED THE DOORS BEHIND THEM JUST THEN A BREATH OF WIND CAME SIGHING OFF THE LAKE AND THE BANNERS STIRRED AND LIFTED THE ONE ON THE TALL STAFF BORE THE GOLDEN LION AS SHED FEARED ON THE OTHER THREE SLEEK BLACK SHAPES RAN ACROSS A FIELD AS

MORE BESIDES MEN CAME AND WENT THEY LED THEIR HORSES DOWN TO THE STREAM TO DRINK A HUNTING PARTY RETURNED FROM THE WOOD CARRYING A DEERS CARCASS SLUNG FROM A POLE SHE WATCHED THEM CLEAN AND GUT IT AND

WOOLEN DOUBLET AND OVER IT ALL HE HAD THROWN THE SHADOWSKIN CLOAK HE HAD ACQUIRED IN THE MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON THE CLOAK WAS ABSURDLY LONG MADE FOR A MAN TWICE HIS HEIGHT WHEN HE WAS NOT AHORSE THE ONLY WAY TO WEAR THE THING WAS TO WRAP IT AROUND HIM SEVERAL TIMES WHICH MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A BALL OF STRIPED FUREVEN SO HE WAS GLAD HE HAD LISTENED THE CHILL IN THE LONG DANK VAULT WENT BONE DEEP TIMETT HAD CHOSEN TO RETREAT BACK UP TO THE CELLAR AFTER A BRIEF TASTE OF THE COLD BELOW THEY WERE SOMEWHERE UNDER THE HILL OF RHAENYS BEHIND THE GUILDHALL OF THE ALCHEMISTS THE DAMP STONE WALLS WERE SPLOTCHY WITH NITRE AND THE ONLY LIGHT CAME FROM THE SEALED IRONANDGLASS OIL LAMP THAT HALLYNE THE PYROMANCER CARRIED SO GINGERLYGINGERLY INDEED AND THESE WOULD BE THE GINGER JARS TYRION LIFTED ONE FOR INSPECTION IT WAS ROUND AND RUDDY A FAT CLAY GRAPEFRUIT A LITTLE BIG FOR HIS HAND BUT IT WOULD FIT COMFORTABLY IN THE GRIP OF A NORMAL MAN HE KNEW THE POTTERY WAS THIN SO FRAGILE THAT EVEN HE HAD BEEN WARNED NOT TO SQUEEZE TOO TIGHTLY LEST HE CRUSH IT IN HIS FIST THE CLAY FELT ROUGHENED PEBBLED HALLYNE TOLD HIM THAT WAS INTENTIONAL A SMOOTH POT IS MORE APT TO SLIP FROM A MANS GRASPTHE WILDFIRE OOZED SLOWLY TOWARD THE LIP OF THE JAR WHEN TYRION TILTED IT TO PEER INSIDE THE COLOR WOULD BE A MURKY GREEN HE KNEW BUT THE POOR LIGHT MADE THAT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONFIRM THICK HE OBSERVEDTHAT IS FROM THE COLD MY LORD SAID HALLYNE A PALLID MAN WITH SOFT DAMP HANDS AND AN OBSEQUIOUS MANNER HE WAS DRESSED IN STRIPED BLACKANDSCARLET ROBES TRIMMED WITH SABLE BUT THE FUR LOOKED MORE THAN A LITTLE PATCHY AND MOTHEATEN AS IT WARMS THE SUBSTANCE WILL FLOW MORE EASILY LIKE LAMP OILTHE SUBSTANCE WAS THE PYROMANCERS OWN TERM FOR WILDFIRE THEY CALLED EACH OTHER WISDOM AS WELL WHICH TYRION FOUND ALMOST AS ANNOYING AS THEIR CUSTOM OF HINTING AT THE VAST SECRET STORES OF KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY WANTED HIM TO THINK THEY POSSESSED ONCE THEIRS HAD BEEN A POWERFUL GUILD BUT IN RECENT CENTURIES THE MAESTERS OF THE CITADEL HAD SUPPLANTED THE ALCHEMISTS ALMOST EVERYWHERE NOW ONLY A FEW OF THE OLDER ORDER REMAINED AND THEY NO LONGER EVEN PRETENDED TO TRANSMUTE METALS BUT THEY COULD MAKE WILDFIRE WATER WILL NOT QUENCH IT I AM TOLDTHAT IS SO ONCE IT TAKES FIRE THE SUBSTANCE WILL BURN FIERCELY UNTIL IT IS NO MORE MORE IT WILL SEEP INTO CLOTH WOOD LEATHER EVEN STEEL SO THEY TAKE FIRE AS WELLTYRION REMEMBERED THE RED PRIEST THOROS OF MYR AND HIS FLAMING SWORD EVEN A THIN COATING OF WILDFIRE COULD BURN FOR AN HOUR THOROS ALWAYS NEEDED A NEW SWORD AFTER A MELEE BUT ROBERT HAD BEEN FOND OF THE MAN AND EVER GLAD TO PROVIDE ONE WHY DOESNT IT SEEP INTO THE CLAY AS WELLOH BUT IT DOES SAID HALLYNE THERE IS A VAULT BELOW THIS ONE WHERE WE STORE THE OLDER POTS THOSE FROM KING AERYSS DAY IT WAS HIS FANCY TO HAVE THE JARS MADE IN THE SHAPES OF FRUITS VERY PERILOUS FRUITS INDEED MY LORD HAND AND HMMM RIPER NOW THAN EVER IF YOU TAKE MY MEANING WE HAVE SEALED THEM WITH WAX AND PUMPED THE LOWER VAULT FULL OF WATER BUT EVEN SO BY RIGHTS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BUT SO MANY OF OUR MASTERS WERE MURDERED DURING THE SACK OF KINGS LANDING THE FEW ACOLYTES WHO REMAINED WERE UNEQUAL TO THE TASK AND MUCH OF THE STOCK WE MADE FOR AERYS WAS LOST ONLY LAST YEAR TWO HUNDRED JARS WERE DISCOVERED IN A STOREROOM BENEATH THE GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR NO ONE COULD RECALL HOW THEY CAME THERE BUT IM SURE I DO NOT NEED TO TELL YOU THAT THE HIGH SEPTON WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH TERROR I MYSELF SAW THAT THEY WERE SAFELY MOVED I HAD A CART FILLED WITH SAND AND SENT OUR MOST ABLE ACOLYTES WE WORKED ONLY BY NIGHT WEDID A SPLENDID JOB I HAVE NO DOUBT TYRION PLACED THE JAR HED BEEN HOLDING BACK AMONG ITS FELLOWS THEY COVERED THE TABLE STANDING IN ORDERLY ROWS OF FOUR AND MARCHING AWAY INTO THE SUBTERRANEAN DIMNESS AND THERE WERE OTHER TABLES BEYOND MANY OTHER TABLES THESE AH FRUITS OF THE LATE KING AERYS CAN THEY STILL BE USEDOH YES MOST CERTAINLY BUT CAREFULLY MY LORD EVER SO CAREFULLY AS IT AGES THE SUBSTANCE GROWS EVER MORE HMMMM FICKLE LET US SAY ANY FLAME WILL SET IT AFIRE ANY SPARK TOO MUCH HEAT AND JARS WILL BLAZE UP OF THEIR OWN ACCORD IT IS NOT WISE TO LET THEM SIT IN SUNLIGHT EVEN FOR A SHORT TIME ONCE THE FIRE BEGINS WITHIN THE HEAT CAUSES THE SUBSTANCE TO EXPAND VIOLENTLY AND THE JARS SHORTLY FLY TO PIECES IF OTHER JARS SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE STORED IN THE SAME VICINITY THOSE GO UP AS WELL AND SOHOW MANY JARS DO YOU HAVE AT PRESENTTHIS MORNING THE WISDOM MUNCITER TOLD ME THAT WE HAD SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY THAT COUNT INCLUDES FOUR THOUSAND JARS FROM KING AERYSS DAY TO BE SUREOUR OVERRIPE FRUITSHALLYNE BOBBED HIS HEAD WISDOM MALLIARD BELIEVES WE SHALL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A FULL TEN THOUSAND JARS AS WAS PROMISED THE QUEEN I CONCUR THE PYROMANCER LOOKED INDECENTLY PLEASED WITH THAT PROSPECTASSUMING OUR ENEMIES GIVE YOU THE TIME THE PYROMANCERS KEPT THEIR RECIPE FOR WILDFIRE A CLOSELY GUARDED SECRET BUT TYRION KNEW THAT IT WAS A LENGTHY DANGEROUS AND TIMECONSUMING PROCESS HE HAD ASSUMED THE PROMISE OF TEN THOUSAND JARS WAS A WILD BOAST LIKE THAT OF THE BANNERMAN WHO VOWS TO MARSHAL TEN THOUSAND SWORDS FOR HIS LORD AND SHOWS UP ON THE DAY OF BATTLE WITH A HUNDRED AND TWO IF THEY CAN TRULY GIVE US TEN THOUSAND HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HE OUGHT TO BE DELIGHTED OR TERRIFIED PERHAPS A SMIDGE OF BOTH I TRUST THAT YOUR GUILD BROTHERS ARE NOT ENGAGING IN ANY UNSEEMLY HASTE WISDOM WE DO NOT WANT TEN THOUSAND JARS OF DEFECTIVE WILDFIRE NOR EVEN ONE AND WE MOST CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT ANY MISHAPSTHERE WILL BE NO MISHAPS MY LORD HAND THE SUBSTANCE IS PREPARED BY TRAINED ACOLYTES IN A SERIES OF BARE STONE CELLS AND EACH JAR IS REMOVED BY AN APPRENTICE AND CARRIED DOWN HERE THE INSTANT IT IS READY ABOVE EACH WORK CELL IS A ROOM FILLED ENTIRELY WITH SAND A PROTECTIVE SPELL HAS BEEN LAID ON THE FLOORS HMMM MOST POWERFUL ANY FIRE IN THE CELL BELOW CAUSES THE FLOORS TO FALL AWAY AND THE SAND SMOTHERS THE BLAZE AT ONCENOT TO MENTION THE CARELESS ACOLYTE BY SPELL TYRION IMAGINED HALLYNE MEANT CLEVER TRICK HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO INSPECT ONE OF THESE FALSECEILINGED CELLS TO SEE HOW IT WORKED BUT THIS WAS NOT THE TIME PERHAPS WHEN THE WAR WAS WONMY BRETHREN ARE NEVER CARELESS HALLYNE INSISTED IF I MAY BE HMMMM FRANK OH DOTHE SUBSTANCE FLOWS THROUGH MY VEINS AND LIVES IN THE HEART OF EVERY PYROMANCER WE RESPECT ITS POWER BUT THE COMMON SOLDIER HMMMM THE CREW OF ONE OF THE QUEENS SPITFIRES SAY IN THE UNTHINKING FRENZY OF BATTLE ANY LITTLE MISTAKE CAN BRING CATASTROPHE THAT CANNOT BE SAID TOO OFTEN MY FATHER OFTEN TOLD KING AERYS AS MUCH AS HIS FATHER TOLD OLD KING JAEHAERYSTHEY MUST HAVE LISTENED TYRION SAID IF THEY HAD BURNED THE CITY DOWN SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME SO YOUR COUNSEL IS THAT WE HAD BEST BE CAREFULBE VERY CAREFUL

ONLY A DIFFERENT SORT OF KNOWLEDGEWHAT WAS ITLUWIN SET DOWN HIS QUILL NO ONE TRULY KNOWS BRAN THE CHILDREN ARE GONE FROM THE WORLD AND THEIR WISDOM WITH THEM IT HAD TO DO WITH THE FACES IN THE TREES WE THINK THE FIRST MEN BELIEVED THAT THE GREENSEERS COULD SEE THROUGH THE EYES OF THE WEIRWOODS THAT WAS WHY THEY CUT DOWN THE TREES WHENEVER THEY WARRED UPON THE CHILDREN SUPPOSEDLY THE GREENSEERS ALSO HAD POWER OVER THE BEASTS OF THE WOOD AND THE BIRDS IN THE TREES EVEN FISH DOES THE REED BOY CLAIM SUCH POWERSNO I DONT THINK BUT HE HAS DREAMS THAT COME TRUE SOMETIMES MEERA SAYSALL OF US HAVE DREAMS THAT COME TRUE SOMETIMES YOU DREAMED OF YOUR LORD FATHER IN THE CRYPTS BEFORE WE KNEW HE WAS DEAD REMEMBERRICKON DID TOO WE DREAMED THE SAME DREAMCALL IT GREENSIGHT IF YOU WISH BUT REMEMBER AS WELL ALL THOSE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DREAMS THAT YOU AND RICKON HAVE DREAMED THAT DID NOT COME TRUE DO YOU PERCHANCE RECALL WHAT I TAUGHT YOU ABOUT THE CHAIN COLLAR THAT EVERY MAESTER WEARSBRAN THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT TRYING TO REMEMBER A MAESTER FORGES HIS CHAIN IN THE CITADEL OF OLDTOWN ITS A CHAIN BECAUSE YOU SWEAR TO SERVE AND ITS MADE OF DIFFERENT METALS BECAUSE YOU SERVE THE REALM AND THE REALM HAS DIFFERENT SORTS OF PEOPLE EVERY TIME YOU LEARN SOMETHING YOU GET ANOTHER LINK BLACK IRON IS FOR RAVENRY SILVER FOR HEALING GOLD FOR SUMS AND NUMBERS I DONT REMEMBER THEM ALLLUWIN SLID A FINGER UP UNDER HIS COLLAR AND BEGAN TO TURN IT INCH BY INCH HE HAD A THICK NECK FOR A SMALL MAN AND THE CHAIN WAS TIGHT BUT A FEW PULLS HAD IT ALL THE WAY AROUND THIS IS VALYRIAN STEEL HE SAID WHEN THE LINK OF DARK GREY METAL LAY AGAINST THE APPLE OF HIS THROAT ONLY ONE MAESTER IN A HUNDRED WEARS SUCH A LINK THIS SIGNIFIES THAT I HAVE STUDIED WHAT THE CITADEL CALLS THE HIGHER MYSTERIESMAGIC FOR WANT OF A BETTER WORD A FASCINATING PURSUIT BUT OF SMALL USE WHICH IS WHY SO FEW MAESTERS TROUBLE THEMSELVES WITH ITALL THOSE WHO STUDY THE HIGHER MYSTERIES TRY THEIR OWN HAND AT SPELLS SOON OR LATE I YIELDED TO THE TEMPTATION TOO I MUST CONFESS IT WELL I WAS A BOY AND WHAT BOY DOES NOT SECRETLY WISH TO FIND HIDDEN POWERS IN HIMSELF I GOT NO MORE FOR MY EFFORTS THAN A THOUSAND BOYS BEFORE ME AND A THOUSAND SINCE SAD TO SAY MAGIC DOES NOT WORKSOMETIMES IT DOES BRAN PROTESTED I HAD THAT DREAM AND RICKON DID TOO AND THERE ARE MAGES AND WARLOCKS IN THE EAST THERE ARE MEN WHO CALL THEMSELVES MAGES AND WARLOCKS MAESTER LUWIN SAID I HAD A FRIEND AT THE CITADEL WHO COULD PULL A ROSE OUT OF YOUR EAR BUT HE WAS NO MORE MAGICAL THAN I WAS OH TO BE SURE THERE IS MUCH WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE YEARS PASS IN THEIR HUNDREDS AND THEIR THOUSANDS AND WHAT DOES ANY MAN SEE OF LIFE BUT A FEW SUMMERS A FEW WINTERS WE LOOK AT MOUNTAINS AND CALL THEM ETERNAL AND SO THEY SEEM BUT IN THE COURSE OF TIME MOUNTAINS RISE AND FALL RIVERS CHANGE THEIR COURSES STARS FALL FROM THE SKY AND GREAT CITIES SINK BENEATH THE SEA EVEN GODS DIE WE THINK EVERYTHING CHANGESPERHAPS MAGIC WAS ONCE A MIGHTY FORCE IN THE WORLD BUT NO LONGER WHAT LITTLE REMAINS IS NO MORE THAN THE WISP OF SMOKE THAT LINGERS IN THE AIR AFTER A GREAT FIRE HAS BURNED OUT AND EVEN THAT IS FADING VALYRIA WAS THE LAST EMBER AND VALYRIA IS GONE THE DRAGONS ARE NO MORE THE GIANTS ARE DEAD THE CHILDREN OF THE FOREST FORGOTTEN WITH ALL THEIR LORENO MY PRINCE JOJEN REED MAY HAVE HAD A DREAM OR TWO THAT HE BELIEVES CAME TRUE BUT HE DOES NOT HAVE THE

SCRATCHING AT THE BARK THE NOISE HAD SOUNDED SOMETHING LIKE THATAND HE HEARD IT AGAIN CLINK AND SCRAPE IT BROUGHT HIM TO HIS FEET HIS EARS PRICKED AND HIS TAIL ROSE HE HOWLED A LONG DEEP SHIVERY CRY A HOWL TO WAKE THE SLEEPERS BUT THE PILES OF MANROCK WERE DARK AND DEAD A STILL WET NIGHT A NIGHT TO DRIVE MEN INTO THEIR HOLES THE RAIN HAD STOPPED BUT THE MEN STILL HID FROM THE DAMP HUDDLED BY THE FIRES IN THEIR CAVES OF PILED STONEHIS BROTHER CAME SLIDING THROUGH THE TREES MOVING ALMOST AS QUIET AS ANOTHER BROTHER HE REMEMBERED DIMLY FROM LONG AGO THE WHITE ONE WITH THE EYES OF BLOOD THIS BROTHERS EYES WERE POOLS OF SHADOW BUT THE FUR ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK WAS BRISTLING HE HAD HEARD THE SOUNDS AS WELL AND KNOWN THEY MEANT DANGERTHIS TIME THE CLINK AND SCRAPE WERE FOLLOWED BY A SLITHERING AND THE SOFT SWIFT PATTER OF SKINFEET ON STONE THE WIND BROUGHT THE FAINTEST WHIFF OF A MANSMELL HE DID NOT KNOW STRANGER DANGER DEATHHE RAN TOWARD THE SOUND HIS BROTHER RACING BESIDE HIM THE STONE DENS ROSE BEFORE THEM WALLS SLICK AND WET HE BARED HIS TEETH BUT THE MANROCK TOOK NO NOTICE A GATE LOOMED UP A BLACK IRON SNAKE COILED TIGHT ABOUT BAR AND POST WHEN HE CRASHED AGAINST IT THE GATE SHUDDERED AND THE SNAKE CLANKED AND SLITHERED AND HELD THROUGH THE BARS HE COULD LOOK DOWN THE LONG STONE BURROW THAT RAN BETWEEN THE WALLS TO THE STONY FIELD BEYOND BUT THERE WAS NO WAY THROUGH HE COULD FORCE HIS MUZZLE BETWEEN THE BARS BUT NO MORE MANY A TIME HIS BROTHER HAD TRIED TO CRACK THE BLACK BONES OF THE GATE BETWEEN HIS TEETH BUT THEY WOULD NOT BREAK THEY HAD TRIED TO DIG UNDER BUT THERE WERE GREAT FLAT STONES BENEATH HALFCOVERED BY EARTH AND BLOWN LEAVESSNARLING HE PACED BACK AND FORTH IN FRONT OF THE GATE THEN THREW HIMSELF AT IT ONCE MORE IT MOVED A LITTLE AND SLAMMED HIM BACK LOCKED SOMETHING WHISPERED CHAINED THE VOICE HE DID NOT HEAR THE SCENT WITHOUT A SMELL THE OTHER WAYS WERE CLOSED AS WELL WHERE DOORS OPENED IN THE WALLS OF MANROCK THE WOOD WAS THICK AND STRONG THERE WAS NO WAY OUTTHERE IS THE WHISPER CAME AND IT SEEMED AS IF HE COULD SEE THE SHADOW OF A GREAT TREE COVERED IN NEEDLES SLANTING UP OUT OF THE BLACK EARTH TO TEN TIMES THE HEIGHT OF A MAN YET WHEN HE LOOKED ABOUT IT WAS NOT THERE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GODSWOOD THE SENTINEL HURRY HURRY THROUGH THE GLOOM OF NIGHT CAME A MUFFLED SHOUT CUT SHORTSWIFTLY SWIFTLY HE WHIRLED AND BOUNDED BACK INTO THE TREES WET LEAVES RUSTLING BENEATH HIS PAWS BRANCHES WHIPPING AT HIM AS HE RUSHED PAST HE COULD HEAR HIS BROTHER FOLLOWING CLOSE THEY PLUNGED UNDER THE HEART TREE AND AROUND THE COLD POOL THROUGH THE BLACKBERRY BUSHES UNDER A TANGLE OF OAKS AND ASH AND HAWTHORN SCRUB TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE WOOD AND THERE IT WAS THE SHADOW HED GLIMPSED WITHOUT SEEING THE SLANTING TREE POINTING AT THE ROOFTOPS SENTINEL CAME THE THOUGHTHE REMEMBERED HOW IT WAS TO CLIMB IT THEN THE NEEDLES EVERYWHERE SCRATCHING AT HIS BARE FACE AND FALLING DOWN THE BACK OF HIS NECK THE STICKY SAP ON HIS HANDS THE SHARP PINEY SMELL OF IT IT WAS AN EASY TREE FOR A BOY TO CLIMB LEANING AS IT DID CROOKED THE BRANCHES SO CLOSE TOGETHER THEY ALMOST MADE A LADDER SLANTING RIGHT UP TO THE ROOFGROWLING HE SNIFFED AROUND THE BASE OF THE TREE LIFTED A LEG AND MARKED IT WITH A STREAM OF URINE A LOW BRANCH BRUSHED HIS FACE AND HE SNAPPED AT IT TWISTING AND PULLING UNTIL THE WOOD CRACKED AND TORE HIS MOUTH WAS FULL OF NEEDLES AND THE BITTER TASTE OF THE SAP HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SNARLEDHIS BROTHER SAT BACK ON HIS HAUNCHES AND LIFTED HIS VOICE IN A ULULATING HOWL HIS SONG BLACK WITH MOURNING THE WAY WAS NO WAY THEY WERE NOT

SPRANG AWAY FROM THE WALL LOPED OFF BENEATH THE TREES THE SHADOWS OF BRANCH AND LEAF DAPPLING HIS GREY FUR AND THEN HE TURNED AND RACED BACK IN A RUSH HIS FEET FLEW KICKING UP WET LEAVES AND PINE NEEDLES AND FOR A LITTLE TIME HE WAS A HUNTER AND AN ANTLERED STAG WAS FLEEING BEFORE HIM AND HE COULD SEE IT SMELL IT AND HE RAN FULL OUT IN PURSUIT THE SMELL OF FEAR MADE HIS HEART THUNDER AND SLAVER RAN FROM HIS JAWS AND HE REACHED THE FALLING TREE IN STRIDE AND THREW HIMSELF UP THE TRUNK CLAWS SCRABBLING AT THE BARK FOR PURCHASE UPWARD HE BOUNDED UP TWO BOUNDS THREE HARDLY SLOWING UNTIL HE WAS AMONG THE LOWER LIMBS BRANCHES TANGLED HIS FEET AND WHIPPED AT HIS EYES GREYGREEN NEEDLES SCATTERED AS HE SHOULDERED THROUGH THEM SNAPPING HE HAD TO SLOW SOMETHING SNAGGED AT HIS FOOT AND HE WRENCHED IT FREE SNARLING THE TRUNK NARROWED UNDER HIM THE SLOPE STEEPER ALMOST STRAIGHT UP AND WET THE BARK TORE LIKE SKIN WHEN HE TRIED TO CLAW AT IT HE WAS A THIRD OF THE WAY UP HALFWAY MORE THE

THROUGH BLACK SHADOWS AMIDST BLACK ROCKS WORKING THEIR WAY UP A STEEP TWISTING TRAIL AS THEIR BREATH FROSTED IN THE BLACK AIR JON FELT ALMOST NAKED WITHOUT HIS MAIL BUT HE DID NOT MISS ITS WEIGHT THIS WAS HARD GOING AND SLOW TO HURRY HERE WAS TO RISK A BROKEN ANKLE OR WORSE STONESNAKE SEEMED TO KNOW WHERE TO PUT HIS FEET AS IF BY INSTINCT BUT JON NEEDED TO BE MORE CAREFUL ON THE BROKEN UNEVEN GROUNDTHE SKIRLING PASS WAS REALLY A SERIES OF PASSES A LONG TWISTING COURSE THAT WENT UP AROUND A SUCCESSION OF ICY WINDCARVED PEAKS AND DOWN THROUGH HIDDEN VALLEYS THAT SELDOM SAW THE SUN APART FROM HIS COMPANIONS JON HAD GLIMPSED NO LIVING MAN SINCE THEYD LEFT THE WOOD BEHIND AND BEGUN TO MAKE THEIR WAY UPWARD THE FROSTFANGS WERE AS CRUEL AS ANY PLACE THE GODS HAD MADE AND AS INIMICAL TO MEN THE WIND CUT LIKE A KNIFE UP HERE AND SHRILLED IN THE NIGHT LIKE A MOTHER MOURNING HER SLAIN CHILDREN WHAT FEW TREES THEY SAW WERE STUNTED GROTESQUE THINGS GROWING SIDEWAYS OUT OF CRACKS AND FISSURES TUMBLED SHELVES OF ROCK OFTEN OVERHUNG THE TRAIL FRINGED WITH HANGING ICICLES THAT LOOKED LIKE LONG WHITE TEETH FROM A DISTANCEYET EVEN SO JON SNOW WAS NOT SORRY HE HAD COME THERE WERE WONDERS HERE AS WELL HE HAD SEEN SUNLIGHT FLASHING ON ICY THIN WATERFALLS AS THEY PLUNGED OVER THE LIPS OF SHEER STONE CLIFFS AND A MOUNTAIN MEADOW FULL OF AUTUMN WILDFLOWERS BLUE COLDSNAPS AND BRIGHT SCARLET FROSTFIRES AND STANDS OF PIPERS GRASS IN RUSSET AND GOLD HE HAD PEERED DOWN RAVINES SO DEEP AND BLACK THEY SEEMED CERTAIN TO END IN SOME HELL AND HE HAD RIDDEN HIS GARRON OVER A WINDEATEN BRIDGE OF NATURAL STONE WITH NOTHING BUT SKY TO EITHER SIDE EAGLES NESTED IN THE HEIGHTS AND CAME DOWN TO HUNT THE VALLEYS CIRCLING EFFORTLESSLY ON GREAT BLUEGREY WINGS THAT SEEMED ALMOST PART OF THE SKY ONCE HE HAD WATCHED A SHADOWCAT STALK A RAM FLOWING DOWN THE MOUNTAINSIDE LIKE LIQUID SMOKE UNTIL IT WAS READY TO POUNCENOW IT IS OUR TURN TO POUNCE HE WISHED HE COULD MOVE AS SURE AND SILENT AS THAT SHADOWCAT AND KILL AS QUICKLY LONGCLAW WAS SHEATHED ACROSS HIS BACK BUT HE MIGHT NOT HAVE ROOM TO USE IT HE CARRIED DIRK AND DAGGER FOR CLOSER WORK THEY WILL HAVE WEAPONS AS WELL AND I AM NOT ARMORED HE WONDERED WHO WOULD PROVE THE SHADOWCAT BY NIGHTS END AND WHO THE RAMFOR A LONG WAY THEY STAYED TO THE TRAIL FOLLOWING ITS TWISTS AND TURNS AS IT SNAKED ALONG THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN UPWARD EVER UPWARD SOMETIMES THE MOUNTAIN FOLDED BACK ON ITSELF AND THEY LOST SIGHT OF THE FIRE BUT SOON OR LATE IT WOULD ALWAYS REAPPEAR THE PATH STONESNAKE CHOSE WOULD NEVER HAVE SERVED FOR THE HORSES IN PLACES JON HAD TO PUT HIS BACK TO THE COLD STONE AND SHUFFLE ALONG SIDEWAYS LIKE A CRAB INCH BY INCH EVEN WHERE THE TRACK WIDENED IT WAS TREACHEROUS THERE WERE CRACKS BIG ENOUGH TO SWALLOW A MANS LEG RUBBLE TO STUMBLE OVER HOLLOW PLACES WHERE THE WATER POOLED BY DAY AND FROZE HARD BY NIGHT ONE STEP AND THEN ANOTHER JON TOLD HIMSELF ONE STEP AND THEN ANOTHER AND I WILL NOT FALLHE HAD NOT SHAVED SINCE LEAVING THE FIST OF THE FIRST MEN AND THE HAIR ON HIS LIP WAS SOON STIFF WITH FROST TWO HOURS INTO THE CLIMB THE WIND KICKED UP SO FIERCELY THAT IT WAS ALL HE COULD DO TO HUNCH DOWN AND CLING TO THE ROCK PRAYING HE WOULD NOT BE BLOWN OFF THE MOUNTAIN ONE STEP AND THEN ANOTHER HE RESUMED WHEN THE GALE SUBSIDED ONE STEP AND THEN ANOTHER AND I WILL NOT FALLSOON THEY WERE HIGH ENOUGH SO THAT LOOKING DOWN WAS BEST NOT CONSIDERED THERE WAS NOTHING BELOW BUT YAWNING BLACKNESS NOTHING ABOVE BUT MOON AND STARS THE MOUNTAIN IS YOUR MOTHER STONESNAKE HAD TOLD HIM DURING AN EASIER CLIMB A FEW DAYS PAST CLING TO HER PRESS YOUR FACE UP AGAINST HER TEATS AND SHE WONT DROP YOU JON HAD MADE A JOKE OF IT SAYING HOW HED ALWAYS WONDERED WHO HIS MOTHER WAS BUT NEVER THOUGHT TO FIND HER IN THE FROSTFANGS IT DID NOT SEEM NEARLY SO AMUSING NOW ONE STEP AND THEN ANOTHER HE THOUGHT CLINGING TIGHTTHE NARROW TRACK ENDED ABRUPTLY WHERE A MASSIVE SHOULDER OF BLACK GRANITE THRUST OUT FROM THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN AFTER THE BRIGHT MOONLIGHT ITS SHADOW WAS SO BLACK THAT IT FELT LIKE STEPPING INTO A CAVE STRAIGHT UP HERE THE RANGER SAID IN A QUIET VOICE WE WANT TO GET ABOVE THEM HE PEELED OFF HIS GLOVES TUCKED THEM THROUGH HIS BELT TIED ONE END OF HIS ROPE AROUND HIS WAIST THE OTHER END AROUND JON FOLLOW ME WHEN THE ROPE GROWS TAUT THE RANGER DID NOT WAIT FOR AN ANSWER BUT STARTED AT ONCE MOVING UPWARD WITH FINGERS AND FEET FASTER THAN JON WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THE LONG ROPE UNWOUND SLOWLY JON WATCHED HIM CLOSELY MAKING NOTE OF HOW HE WENT AND WHERE HE FOUND EACH HANDHOLD AND WHEN THE LAST LOOP OF HEMP UNCOILED HE TOOK OFF HIS OWN GLOVES AND FOLLOWED MUCH MORE SLOWLYSTONESNAKE HAD PASSED THE ROPE AROUND THE SMOOTH SPIKE OF ROCK HE WAS WAITING ON BUT AS SOON AS JON REACHED HIM HE SHOOK IT LOOSE AND WAS OFF AGAIN THIS TIME THERE WAS NO CONVENIENT CLEFT WHEN HE REACHED THE END OF THEIR TETHER SO HE TOOK OUT HIS FELTHEADED HAMMER AND DROVE A SPIKE DEEP INTO A CRACK IN THE STONE WITH A SERIES OF GENTLE TAPS SOFT AS THE SOUNDS WERE THEY ECHOED OFF THE STONE SO LOUDLY THAT JON WINCED WITH EVERY BLOW CERTAIN THAT THE WILDLINGS MUST HEAR THEM TOO WHEN THE SPIKE WAS SECURE STONESNAKE SECURED THE ROPE TO IT AND JON STARTED AFTER HIM SUCK ON THE MOUNTAINS TEAT HE REMINDED HIMSELF DONT LOOK DOWN KEEP YOUR WEIGHT ABOVE YOUR FEET DONT LOOK DOWN LOOK AT THE ROCK IN FRONT OF YOU THERES A GOOD HANDHOLD YES DONT LOOK DOWN I CAN CATCH A BREATH ON THAT LEDGE THERE ALL I NEED TO DO IS REACH IT NEVER LOOK DOWNONCE HIS FOOT SLIPPED AS HE PUT HIS WEIGHT ON IT AND HIS HEART STOPPED IN HIS CHEST BUT THE GODS WERE GOOD AND HE DID NOT FALL HE COULD FEEL THE COLD SEEPING OFF THE ROCK INTO HIS FINGERS BUT HE DARED NOT DON HIS GLOVES GLOVES WOULD SLIP NO MATTER HOW TIGHT THEY SEEMED CLOTH AND FUR MOVING BETWEEN SKIN AND STONE AND UP HERE THAT COULD KILL HIM HIS BURNED HAND WAS STIFFENING UP ON HIM AND SOON IT BEGAN TO ACHE THEN HE RIPPED OPEN HIS THUMBNAIL SOMEHOW AND AFTER THAT HE LEFT SMEARS OF BLOOD WHEREVER HE PUT HIS HAND HE HOPED HE STILL HAD ALL HIS FINGERS BY THE END OF THE CLIMBUP THEY WENT AND UP AND UP BLACK SHADOWS CREEPING ACROSS THE MOONLIT WALL OF ROCK ANYONE DOWN ON THE FLOOR OF THE PASS COULD HAVE SEEN THEM EASILY BUT THE MOUNTAIN HID THEM FROM THE VIEW OF THE WILDLINGS BY THEIR FIRE THEY WERE CLOSE NOW THOUGH JON COULD SENSE IT EVEN SO HE DID NOT THINK OF THE FOES WHO WERE WAITING FOR HIM ALL UNKNOWING BUT OF HIS BROTHER AT WINTERFELL BRAN USED TO LOVE TO CLIMB I WISH I HAD A TENTH PART OF HIS COURAGETHE WALL WAS BROKEN TWOTHIRDS OF THE WAY UP BY A CROOKED FISSURE OF ICY STONE STONESNAKE REACHED DOWN A HAND TO HELP HIM UP HE HAD DONNED HIS GLOVES AGAIN SO JON DID THE SAME THE RANGER MOVED HIS HEAD TO THE LEFT AND THE TWO OF THEM CRAWLED ALONG THE SHELF THREE HUNDRED YARDS OR MORE UNTIL THEY COULD SEE THE DULL ORANGE GLOW BEYOND THE LIP OF THE CLIFFTHE WILDLINGS HAD BUILT THEIR WATCHFIRE IN A SHALLOW DEPRESSION ABOVE THE NARROWEST PART OF THE PASS WITH A SHEER DROP BELOW AND ROCK BEHIND TO SHELTER THEM FROM THE WORST OF THE WIND THAT SAME WINDBREAK ALLOWED THE BLACK BROTHERS TO CRAWL WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THEM CREEPING ALONG ON THEIR BELLIES UNTIL THEY WERE LOOKING DOWN ON THE MEN THEY MUST KILLONE WAS ASLEEP CURLED UP TIGHT AND BURIED BENEATH A GREAT MOUND OF SKINS JON COULD SEE NOTHING OF HIM BUT HIS HAIR BRIGHT RED IN THE FIRELIGHT THE SECOND SAT CLOSE TO THE FLAMES FEEDING THEM TWIGS AND BRANCHES AND COMPLAINING OF THE WIND IN A QUERULOUS TONE THE THIRD WATCHED THE PASS THOUGH THERE WAS LITTLE TO SEE ONLY A VAST BOWL OF DARKNESS RINGED BY THE SNOWY SHOULDERS OF THE MOUNTAINS IT WAS THE WATCHER WHO WORE THE HORNTHREE FOR A MOMENT JON WAS UNCERTAIN THERE WAS ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE TWO ONE WAS ASLEEP THOUGH AND WHETHER THERE WAS TWO OR THREE OR TWENTY HE STILL MUST DO WHAT HE HAD COME TO DO STONESNAKE TOUCHED HIS ARM POINTED AT THE WILDLING WITH THE HORN JON NODDED TOWARD THE ONE BY THE FIRE IT FELT QUEER PICKING A MAN TO

ADMIRE THE COURAGE OF THE WILDLING WHO REACHED FIRST FOR HIS HORN INSTEAD OF HIS BLADE HE GOT IT TO HIS LIPS BUT BEFORE HE COULD SOUND IT STONESNAKE KNOCKED THE HORN ASIDE WITH A SWIPE OF HIS SHORTSWORD JONS MAN LEAPT TO HIS FEET THRUSTING AT HIS FACE WITH A BURNING BRAND HE COULD FEEL THE HEAT OF THE FLAMES AS HE FLINCHED BACK OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE HE SAW THE SLEEPER STIRRING AND

WHILE THE FLEET LAY ANCHORED AT THE MOUTH OF THE WENDWATER IN ORDER TO ACQUAINT THEM WITH HIS DISPOSITIONS DAVOS AND HIS SONS HAD BEEN ASSIGNED A PLACE IN THE SECOND LINE OF BATTLE WELL OUT ON THE DANGEROUS STARBOARD WING A PLACE OF HONOR ALLARD HAD DECLARED WELL SATISFIED WITH THE CHANCE TO PROVE HIS VALOR A PLACE OF PERIL HIS FATHER HAD POINTED OUT HIS SONS HAD GIVEN HIM PITYING LOOKS EVEN YOUNG MARIC THE ONION KNIGHT HAS BECOME AN OLD WOMAN HE COULD HEAR THEM THINKING STILL A SMUGGLER AT HEARTWELL THE LAST WAS TRUE ENOUGH HE WOULD MAKE NO APOLOGIES FOR IT SEAWORTH HAD A LORDLY RING TO IT BUT DOWN DEEP HE WAS STILL DAVOS OF FLEA BOTTOM COMING HOME TO HIS CITY ON ITS THREE HIGH HILLS HE KNEW AS MUCH OF SHIPS AND SAILS AND SHORES AS ANY MAN IN THE SEVEN KINGDOMS AND HAD FOUGHT HIS SHARE OF DESPERATE FIGHTS SWORD TO SWORD ON A WET DECK BUT TO THIS SORT OF BATTLE HE CAME A MAIDEN NERVOUS AND AFRAID SMUGGLERS DO NOT SOUND WARHORNS AND RAISE BANNERS WHEN THEY SMELL DANGER THEY RAISE SAIL AND RUN BEFORE THE WINDHAD HE BEEN ADMIRAL HE MIGHT HAVE DONE IT ALL DIFFERENTLY FOR A START HE WOULD HAVE SENT A FEW OF HIS SWIFTEST SHIPS TO PROBE UPRIVER AND SEE WHAT AWAITED THEM INSTEAD OF SMASHING IN HEADLONG WHEN HE HAD SUGGESTED AS MUCH TO SER IMRY THE LORD HIGH CAPTAIN HAD THANKED HIM COURTEOUSLY BUT HIS EYES WERE NOT AS POLITE WHO IS THIS LOWBORN CRAVEN THOSE EYES ASKED IS HE THE ONE WHO BOUGHT HIS KNIGHTHOOD WITH AN ONIONWITH FOUR TIMES AS MANY SHIPS AS THE BOY KING SER IMRY SAW NO NEED FOR CAUTION OR DECEPTIVE TACTICS HE HAD ORGANIZED THE FLEET INTO TEN LINES OF BATTLE EACH OF TWENTY SHIPS THE FIRST TWO LINES WOULD SWEEP UP THE RIVER TO ENGAGE AND DESTROY JOFFREYS LITTLE FLEET OR THE BOYS TOYS AS SER IMRY DUBBED THEM TO THE MIRTH OF HIS LORDLY CAPTAINS THOSE THAT FOLLOWED WOULD LAND COMPANIES OF ARCHERS AND SPEARMEN BENEATH THE CITY WALLS AND ONLY THEN JOIN THE FIGHT ON THE RIVER THE SMALLER SLOWER SHIPS TO THE REAR WOULD FERRY OVER THE MAIN PART OF STANNISS HOST FROM THE SOUTH BANK PROTECTED BY SALLADHOR SAAN AND HIS LYSENI WHO WOULD STAND OUT IN THE BAY IN CASE THE LANNISTERS HAD OTHER SHIPS HIDDEN UP ALONG THE COAST POISED TO SWEEP DOWN ON THEIR REARTO BE FAIR THERE WAS REASON FOR SER IMRYS HASTE THE WINDS HAD NOT USED THEM KINDLY ON THE VOYAGE UP FROM STORMS END THEY HAD LOST TWO COGS TO THE ROCKS OF SHIPBREAKER BAY ON THE VERY DAY THEY SET SAIL A POOR WAY TO BEGIN ONE OF THE MYRISH GALLEYS HAD FOUNDERED IN THE STRAITS OF TARTH AND A STORM HAD OVERTAKEN THEM AS THEY WERE ENTERING THE GULLET SCATTERING THE FLEET ACROSS HALF THE NARROW SEA ALL BUT TWELVE SHIPS HAD FINALLY REGROUPED BEHIND THE SHELTERING SPINE OF MASSEYS HOOK IN THE CALMER WATERS OF BLACKWATER BAY BUT NOT BEFORE THEY HAD LOST CONSIDERABLE TIMESTANNIS WOULD HAVE REACHED THE RUSH DAYS AGO THE KINGSROAD RAN FROM STORMS END STRAIGHT TO KINGS LANDING A MUCH SHORTER ROUTE THAN BY SEA AND HIS HOST WAS LARGELY MOUNTED NEAR TWENTY THOUSAND KNIGHTS LIGHT HORSE AND FREERIDERS RENLYS UNWILLING LEGACY TO HIS BROTHER THEY WOULD HAVE MADE GOOD TIME BUT ARMORED DESTRIERS AND TWELVEFOOT LANCES WOULD AVAIL THEM LITTLE AGAINST THE DEEP WATERS OF THE BLACKWATER RUSH AND THE HIGH STONE WALLS OF THE CITY STANNIS WOULD BE CAMPED WITH HIS LORDS ON THE SOUTH BANK OF THE RIVER DOUBTLESS SEETHING WITH IMPATIENCE AND WONDERING WHAT SER IMRY HAD DONE WITH HIS FLEETOFF MERLING ROCK TWO DAYS BEFORE THEY HAD SIGHTED A HALFDOZEN FISHING SKIFFS THE FISHERFOLK HAD FLED BEFORE THEM BUT ONE BY ONE THEY HAD BEEN OVERTAKEN AND BOARDED A SMALL SPOON OF VICTORY IS JUST THE THING TO SETTLE THE STOMACH BEFORE BATTLE SER IMRY HAD DECLARED HAPPILY IT MAKES THE MEN HUNGRY FOR A LARGER HELPING BUT DAVOS HAD BEEN MORE INTERESTED IN WHAT THE CAPTIVES HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE DEFENSES AT KINGS LANDING THE DWARF HAD BEEN BUSY BUILDING SOME SORT OF BOOM TO CLOSE OFF THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER THOUGH THE FISHERMEN DIFFERED AS TO WHETHER THE WORK HAD BEEN COMPLETED OR NOT HE FOUND HIMSELF WISHING IT HAD IF THE RIVER WAS CLOSED TO THEM SER IMRY WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PAUSE AND TAKE STOCKTHE SEA WAS FULL OF SOUND SHOUTS AND CALLS WARHORNS AND DRUMS AND THE TRILL OF PIPES THE SLAP OF WOOD ON WATER AS THOUSANDS OF OARS ROSE AND FELL KEEP LINE DAVOS SHOUTED A GUST OF WIND TUGGED AT HIS OLD GREEN CLOAK A JERKIN OF BOILED LEATHER AND A POTHELM AT HIS FEET WERE HIS ONLY ARMOR AT SEA HEAVY STEEL WAS AS LIKE TO COST A MAN HIS LIFE AS TO SAVE IT HE BELIEVED SER IMRY AND THE OTHER HIGHBORN CAPTAINS DID NOT SHARE HIS VIEW THEY GLITTERED AS THEY PACED THEIR DECKSHARRIDAN AND SEAHORSE HAD SLIPPED INTO THEIR PLACES NOW AND LORD CELTIGARS RED CLAW BEYOND THEM TO STARBOARD OF ALLARDS LADY MARYA WERE THE THREE GALLEYS THAT STANNIS HAD SEIZED FROM THE UNFORTUNATE LORD SUNGLASS PIETY PRAYER AND DEVOTION THEIR DECKS CRAWLING WITH ARCHERS EVEN SWORDFISH WAS CLOSING LUMBERING AND ROLLING THROUGH A THICKENING SEA UNDER BOTH OARS AND SAIL A SHIP OF THAT MANY OARS OUGHT TO BE MUCH FASTER DAVOS REFLECTED WITH DISAPPROVAL ITS THAT RAM SHE CARRIES ITS TOO BIG SHE HAS NO BALANCETHE WIND WAS GUSTING FROM THE SOUTH BUT UNDER OARS IT MADE NO MATTER THEY WOULD BE SWEEPING IN ON THE FLOOD TIDE BUT THE LANNISTERS WOULD HAVE THE RIVER CURRENT TO THEIR FAVOR AND THE BLACKWATER RUSH FLOWED STRONG AND SWIFT WHERE IT MET THE SEA THE FIRST SHOCK WOULD INEVITABLY FAVOR THE FOE WE ARE FOOLS TO MEET THEM ON THE BLACKWATER DAVOS THOUGHT IN ANY ENCOUNTER ON THE OPEN SEA THEIR BATTLE LINES WOULD ENVELOP THE ENEMY FLEET ON BOTH FLANKS DRIVING THEM INWARD TO DESTRUCTION ON THE RIVER THOUGH THE NUMBERS AND WEIGHT OF SER IMRYS SHIPS WOULD COUNT FOR LESS THEY COULD NOT DRESS MORE THAN TWENTY SHIPS ABREAST LEST THEY RISK TANGLING THEIR OARS AND COLLIDING WITH EACH OTHERBEYOND THE LINE OF WARSHIPS DAVOS COULD SEE THE RED KEEP UP ON AEGONS HIGH HILL DARK AGAINST A LEMON SKY WITH THE MOUTH OF THE RUSH OPENING OUT BELOW ACROSS THE RIVER THE SOUTH SHORE WAS BLACK WITH MEN AND HORSES STIRRING LIKE ANGRY ANTS AS THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE APPROACHING SHIPS STANNIS WOULD HAVE KEPT THEM BUSY BUILDING RAFTS AND FLETCHING ARROWS YET EVEN SO THE WAITING WOULD HAVE BEEN A HARD THING TO BEAR TRUMPETS SOUNDED FROM AMONG THEM TINY AND BRAZEN SOON SWALLOWED BY THE ROAR OF A THOUSAND SHOUTS DAVOS CLOSED HIS STUBBY HAND AROUND THE POUCH THAT HELD HIS FINGERBONES AND MOUTHED A SILENT PRAYER FOR LUCKFURY HERSELF WOULD CENTER THE FIRST LINE OF BATTLE FLANKED BY THE LORD STEFFON AND THE STAG OF THE SEA EACH OF TWO HUNDRED OARS ON THE PORT AND STARBOARD WINGS WERE THE HUNDREDS LADY HARRA BRIGHTFISH LAUGHING LORD SEA DEMON HORNED HONOR RAGGED JENNA TRIDENT THREE SWIFT SWORD PRINCESS RHAENYS DOGS NOSE SCEPTRE FAITHFUL RED RAVEN QUEEN ALYSANNE CAT COURAGEOUS AND DRAGONSBANE FROM

SMALLER SLOWER MYRISH CONTINGENT NONE DIPPING MORE THAN EIGHTY OARS FARTHER BACK WOULD COME THE SAILED SHIPS CARRACKS AND LUMBERING GREAT COGS AND LAST OF ALL SALLADHOR SAAN IN HIS PROUD VALYRIAN A TOWERING THREEHUNDRED PACED BY THE REST OF HIS GALLEYS WITH THEIR DISTINCTIVE STRIPED HULLS THE FLAMBOYANT LYSENI PRINCELING HAD NOT BEEN PLEASED TO BE ASSIGNED THE REAR GUARD BUT IT WAS CLEAR THAT SER IMRY TRUSTED HIM NO MORE THAN STANNIS DID TOO MANY COMPLAINTS AND TOO MUCH TALK OF THE GOLD HE WAS OWED DAVOS WAS SORRY NONETHELESS SALLADHOR SAAN WAS A RESOURCEFUL OLD PIRATE AND HIS CREWS WERE BORN SEAMEN FEARLESS IN A FIGHT THEY WERE WASTED IN THE REARAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THE CALL ROLLED ACROSS WHITECAPS AND CHURNING OARS FROM THE FORECASTLE OF THE FURY SER IMRY WAS SOUNDING THE ATTACK AHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO AHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSWORDFISH HAD JOINED THE LINE AT LAST THOUGH SHE STILL HAD HER SAIL RAISED FAST CRUISE DAVOS BARKED THE DRUM BEGAN TO BEAT MORE QUICKLY AND THE STROKE PICKED UP THE BLADES OF THE OARS CUTTING WATER SPLASHSWOOSH SPLASHSWOOSH SPLASHSWOOSH ON DECK SOLDIERS BANGED SWORD AGAINST SHIELD WHILE ARCHERS QUIETLY STRUNG THEIR BOWS AND PULLED THE FIRST ARROW FROM THE QUIVERS AT THEIR BELTS THE GALLEYS OF THE FIRST LINE OF BATTLE OBSCURED HIS VISION SO DAVOS PACED THE DECK SEARCHING FOR A BETTER VIEW HE SAW NO SIGN OF ANY BOOM THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER WAS OPEN AS IF TO SWALLOW THEM ALL EXCEPT IN HIS SMUGGLING DAYS DAVOS HAD OFTEN JESTED THAT HE KNEW THE WATERFRONT AT KINGS LANDING A DEAL BETTER THAN THE BACK OF HIS HAND SINCE HE HAD NOT SPENT A GOOD PART OF HIS LIFE SNEAKING IN AND OUT OF THE BACK OF HIS HAND THE SQUAT TOWERS OF RAW NEW STONE THAT STOOD OPPOSITE ONE ANOTHER AT THE MOUTH OF THE BLACKWATER MIGHT MEAN NOTHING TO SER IMRY FLORENT BUT TO HIM IT WAS AS IF TWO EXTRA FINGERS HAD SPROUTED FROM HIS KNUCKLESSHADING HIS EYES AGAINST THE WESTERING SUN HE PEERED AT THOSE TOWERS MORE CLOSELY THEY WERE TOO SMALL TO HOLD MUCH OF A GARRISON THE ONE ON THE NORTH BANK WAS BUILT AGAINST THE BLUFF WITH THE RED KEEP FROWNING ABOVE ITS COUNTERPART ON THE SOUTH SHORE HAD ITS FOOTING IN THE WATER THEY DUG A CUT THROUGH THE BANK HE KNEW AT ONCE THAT WOULD MAKE THE TOWER VERY DIFFICULT TO ASSAULT ATTACKERS WOULD NEED TO WADE THROUGH THE WATER OR BRIDGE THE LITTLE CHANNEL STANNIS HAD POSTED BOWMEN BELOW TO FIRE UP AT THE DEFENDERS WHENEVER ONE WAS RASH ENOUGH TO LIFT HIS HEAD ABOVE THE RAMPARTS BUT OTHERWISE HAD NOT TROUBLEDSOMETHING FLASHED DOWN LOW WHERE THE DARK WATER SWIRLED AROUND THE BASE OF THE TOWER IT WAS SUNLIGHT ON STEEL AND IT TOLD DAVOS SEAWORTH ALL HE NEEDED TO KNOW A CHAIN BOOM AND YET THEY HAVE NOT CLOSED THE RIVER AGAINST US WHYHE COULD MAKE A GUESS AT THAT AS WELL BUT THERE WAS NO TIME TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION A SHOUT WENT UP FROM THE SHIPS AHEAD AND THE WARHORNS BLEW AGAIN THE ENEMY WAS BEFORE THEMBETWEEN THE FLASHING OARS OF SCEPTRE AND FAITHFUL DAVOS SAW A THIN LINE OF GALLEYS DRAWN ACROSS THE RIVER THE SUN GLINTING OFF THE GOLD PAINT THAT MARKED THEIR HULLS HE KNEW THOSE SHIPS AS WELL AS HE KNEW HIS OWN WHEN HE HAD BEEN A SMUGGLER HED ALWAYS FELT SAFER KNOWING WHETHER THE SAIL ON THE HORIZON MARKED A FAST SHIP OR A SLOW ONE AND WHETHER HER CAPTAIN WAS A YOUNG MAN HUNGRY FOR GLORY OR AN OLD ONE SERVING OUT HIS DAYSAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THE WARHORNS CALLED BATTLE SPEED DAVOS SHOUTED ON PORT AND STARBOARD HE HEARD DALE AND ALLARD GIVING THE SAME COMMAND DRUMS BEGAN TO BEAT FURIOUSLY OARS ROSE AND FELL AND BLACK BETHA SURGED FORWARD WHEN HE GLANCED TOWARD WRAITH DALE GAVE

DISTANCE NOW STRETCHED WIDE AS A SEA BUT THE CITY HAD GROWN GIGANTIC AS WELL GLOWERING DOWN FROM AEGONS HIGH HILL THE RED KEEP COMMANDED THE APPROACHES ITS IRONCROWNED BATTLEMENTS MASSIVE TOWERS AND THICK RED WALLS GAVE IT THE ASPECT OF A FEROCIOUS BEAST HUNCHED ABOVE RIVER AND STREETS THE BLUFFS ON WHICH IT CROUCHED WERE STEEP AND ROCKY SPOTTED WITH LICHEN AND GNARLED THORNY TREES THE FLEET WOULD HAVE TO PASS BELOW THE CASTLE TO REACH THE HARBOR AND CITY BEYONDTHE FIRST LINE WAS IN THE RIVER NOW BUT THE ENEMY GALLEYS WERE BACKING WATER THEY MEAN TO DRAW US IN THEY WANT US JAMMED CLOSE CONSTRICTED NO WAY TO SWEEP AROUND THEIR FLANKS AND WITH THAT BOOM BEHIND US HE PACED HIS DECK CRANING HIS NECK FOR A BETTER LOOK AT JOFFREYS FLEET THE BOYS TOYS INCLUDED THE PONDEROUS GODSGRACE HE SAW THE OLD SLOW PRINCE AEMON THE LADY OF SILK AND HER SISTER LADYS SHAME WILDWIND KINGSLANDER WHITE HART LANCE SEAFLOWER BUT WHERE WAS THE LIONSTAR WHERE WAS THE BEAUTIFUL LADY LYANNA THAT KING

CAPABLE OF OVERMATCHING FURY BY RIGHTS SHE SHOULD HAVE FORMED THE HEART OF ANY DEFENSEDAVOS TASTED A TRAP YET HE SAW NO SIGN OF ANY FOES SWEEPING IN BEHIND THEM ONLY THE GREAT FLEET OF STANNIS BARATHEON IN THEIR ORDERED RANKS STRETCHING BACK TO THE WATERY HORIZON WILL THEY RAISE THE CHAIN AND CUT US IN TWO HE COULD NOT SEE WHAT GOOD THAT WOULD SERVE THE SHIPS LEFT OUT IN THE BAY COULD STILL

ANOTHER AS JON STRUCK SPARKS FROM FLINT AND DAGGER UNTIL FINALLY A WISP OF SMOKE APPEARED QHORIN CAME AND STOOD OVER HIM AS THE FIRST FLAME ROSE UP FLICKERING FROM THE SHAVINGS OF BARK AND DEAD DRY PINE NEEDLES AS SHY AS A MAID ON HER WEDDING NIGHT THE BIG RANGER SAID IN A SOFT VOICE AND NEAR AS FAIR SOMETIMES A MAN FORGETS HOW PRETTY A FIRE CAN BEHE WAS NOT A MAN YOUD EXPECT TO SPEAK OF MAIDS AND WEDDING NIGHTS SO FAR AS JON KNEW QHORIN HAD SPENT HIS WHOLE LIFE IN THE WATCH DID HE EVER LOVE A MAID OR HAVE A WEDDING HE COULD NOT ASK INSTEAD HE FANNED THE FIRE WHEN THE BLAZE WAS ALL ACRACKLE HE PEELED OFF HIS STIFF GLOVES TO WARM HIS HANDS AND SIGHED WONDERING IF EVER A KISS HAD FELT AS GOOD THE WARMTH SPREAD THROUGH HIS FINGERS LIKE MELTING BUTTERTHE HALFHAND EASED HIMSELF TO THE GROUND AND SAT CROSSLEGGED BY THE FIRE THE FLICKERING LIGHT PLAYING ACROSS THE HARD PLANES OF HIS FACE ONLY THE TWO OF THEM REMAINED OF THE FIVE RANGERS WHO HAD FLED THE SKIRLING PASS BACK INTO THE BLUEGREY WILDERNESS OF THE FROSTFANGSAT FIRST JON HAD NURSED THE HOPE THAT SQUIRE DALBRIDGE WOULD KEEP THE WILDLINGS BOTTLED UP IN THE PASS BUT WHEN THEYD HEARD THE CALL OF A FAROFF HORN EVERY MAN OF THEM KNEW THE SQUIRE HAD FALLEN LATER THEY SPIED THE EAGLE SOARING THROUGH THE DUSK ON GREAT BLUEGREY WINGS AND STONESNAKE UNSLUNG HIS BOW BUT THE BIRD FLEW OUT OF RANGE BEFORE HE COULD SO MUCH AS STRING IT EBBEN SPAT AND MUTTERED DARKLY OF WARGS AND SKINCHANGERSTHEY GLIMPSED THE EAGLE TWICE MORE THE DAY AFTER AND HEARD THE HUNTING HORN BEHIND THEM ECHOING AGAINST THE MOUNTAINS EACH TIME IT SEEMED A LITTLE LOUDER A LITTLE CLOSER WHEN NIGHT FELL THE HALFHAND TOLD EBBEN TO TAKE THE SQUIRES GARRON AS WELL AS HIS OWN AND RIDE EAST FOR MORMONT WITH ALL HASTE BACK THE WAY THEY HAD COME THE REST OF THEM WOULD DRAW OFF THE PURSUIT SEND JON EBBEN HAD URGED HE CAN RIDE AS FAST AS MEJON HAS A DIFFERENT PART TO PLAYHE IS HALF A BOY STILLNO SAID QHORIN HE IS A MAN OF THE NIGHTS WATCHWHEN THE MOON ROSE EBBEN PARTED FROM THEM STONESNAKE WENT EAST WITH HIM A SHORT WAY THEN DOUBLED BACK TO OBSCURE THEIR TRACKS AND THE THREE WHO REMAINED SET OFF TOWARD THE SOUTHWESTAFTER THAT THE DAYS AND NIGHTS BLURRED ONE INTO THE OTHER THEY SLEPT IN THEIR SADDLES AND STOPPED ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO FEED AND WATER THE GARRONS THEN MOUNTED UP AGAIN OVER BARE ROCK THEY RODE THROUGH GLOOMY PINE FORESTS AND DRIFTS OF OLD SNOW OVER ICY RIDGES AND ACROSS SHALLOW RIVERS THAT HAD NO NAMES SOMETIMES QHORIN OR STONESNAKE WOULD LOOP BACK TO SWEEP AWAY THEIR TRACKS BUT IT WAS A FUTILE GESTURE THEY WERE WATCHED AT EVERY DAWN AND EVERY DUSK THEY SAW THE EAGLE SOARING BETWEEN THE PEAKS NO MORE THAN A SPECK IN THE VASTNESS OF THE SKYTHEY WERE SCALING A LOW RIDGE BETWEEN TWO SNOWCAPPED PEAKS WHEN A SHADOWCAT CAME SNARLING FROM ITS LAIR NOT TEN YARDS AWAY THE BEAST WAS GAUNT AND HALFSTARVED BUT THE SIGHT OF IT SENT STONESNAKES MARE INTO A PANIC SHE REARED AND RAN AND BEFORE THE RANGER COULD GET HER BACK UNDER CONTROL SHE HAD STUMBLED ON THE STEEP SLOPE AND BROKEN A LEGGHOST ATE WELL THAT DAY AND QHORIN INSISTED THAT THE RANGERS MIX SOME OF THE GARRONS BLOOD WITH THEIR OATS TO GIVE THEM STRENGTH THE TASTE OF THAT FOUL PORRIDGE ALMOST CHOKED JON BUT HE FORCED IT DOWN THEY EACH CUT A DOZEN STRIPS OF RAW STRINGY MEAT FROM THE CARCASS TO CHEW ON AS THEY RODE AND LEFT THE REST FOR THE SHADOWCATSTHERE WAS NO QUESTION OF RIDING DOUBLE STONESNAKE OFFERED TO LAY IN WAIT FOR THE PURSUIT AND SURPRISE THEM WHEN THEY CAME PERHAPS HE COULD TAKE A FEW OF THEM WITH HIM DOWN TO HELL QHORIN REFUSED IF ANY MAN IN THE NIGHTS WATCH CAN MAKE IT THROUGH THE FROSTFANGS ALONE AND AFOOT IT IS YOU BROTHER YOU CAN GO OVER MOUNTAINS THAT A HORSE MUST GO AROUND MAKE FOR THE FIST TELL MORMONT WHAT JON SAW AND HOW TELL HIM THAT THE OLD POWERS ARE WAKING THAT HE FACES GIANTS AND WARGS AND WORSE TELL HIM THAT THE TREES HAVE EYES AGAINHE HAS NO CHANCE JON THOUGHT WHEN HE WATCHED STONESNAKE VANISH OVER A SNOWCOVERED RIDGE A TINY BLACK BUG CRAWLING ACROSS A RIPPLING EXPANSE OF WHITEAFTER THAT EVERY NIGHT SEEMED COLDER THAN THE NIGHT BEFORE AND MORE LONELY GHOST WAS NOT ALWAYS WITH THEM BUT HE WAS NEVER FAR EITHER EVEN WHEN THEY WERE APART JON SENSED HIS NEARNESS HE WAS GLAD FOR THAT THE HALFHAND WAS NOT THE MOST COMPANIONABLE OF MEN QHORINS LONG GREY BRAID SWUNG SLOWLY WITH THE MOTION OF HIS HORSE OFTEN THEY WOULD RIDE FOR HOURS WITHOUT A WORD SPOKEN THE ONLY SOUNDS THE SOFT SCRAPE OF HORSESHOES ON STONE AND THE KEENING OF THE WIND WHICH BLEW ENDLESSLY THROUGH THE HEIGHTS WHEN HE SLEPT HE DID NOT DREAM NOT OF

THE FLAMES THE TREE HAD BEEN DEAD A LONG TIME BUT IT SEEMED TO LIVE AGAIN IN THE FIRE AS FIERY DANCERS WOKE WITHIN EACH STICK OF WOOD TO WHIRL AND SPIN IN THEIR GLOWING GOWNS OF YELLOW RED AND ORANGEENOUGH QHORIN SAID ABRUPTLY NOW WE RIDERIDE IT WAS DARK BEYOND THE FIRE AND THE NIGHT WAS COLD RIDE WHEREBACK QHORIN MOUNTED HIS WEARY GARRON ONE MORE TIME THE FIRE WILL DRAW THEM PAST I HOPE COME BROTHERJON PULLED ON HIS GLOVES AGAIN AND RAISED HIS HOOD EVEN THE HORSES SEEMED RELUCTANT TO LEAVE THE FIRE THE SUN WAS LONG GONE AND ONLY THE COLD SILVER SHINE OF THE HALFMOON REMAINED TO LIGHT THEIR WAY OVER THE TREACHEROUS GROUND THAT LAY BEHIND THEM HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT QHORIN HAD IN MIND BUT PERHAPS IT WAS A CHANCE HE HOPED SO I DO NOT WANT TO PLAY THE OATHBREAKER EVEN FOR GOOD REASONTHEY WENT CAUTIOUSLY MOVING AS SILENT AS MAN AND HORSE COULD MOVE RETRACING THEIR STEPS UNTIL THEY REACHED THE MOUTH OF A NARROW DEFILE WHERE AN ICY LITTLE STREAM EMERGED FROM BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS JON REMEMBERED THE PLACE THEY HAD WATERED THE HORSES HERE BEFORE THE SUN WENT DOWNTHE WATERS ICING UP QHORIN OBSERVED AS HE TURNED ASIDE ELSE WED RIDE IN THE STREAMBED BUT IF WE BREAK THE ICE THEY ARE LIKE TO SEE KEEP CLOSE TO THE CLIFFS THERES A CROOK A HALF MILE ON THAT WILL HIDE US HE RODE INTO THE DEFILE JON GAVE ONE LAST WISTFUL LOOK TO THEIR DISTANT FIRE AND FOLLOWEDTHE FARTHER IN THEY WENT THE CLOSER THE CLIFFS PRESSED TO EITHER SIDE THEY FOLLOWED THE MOONLIT RIBBON OF STREAM BACK TOWARD ITS SOURCE ICICLES BEARDED ITS STONY BANKS BUT JON COULD STILL HEAR THE SOUND OF RUSHING WATER BENEATH THE THIN HARD CRUSTA GREAT JUMBLE OF FALLEN ROCK BLOCKED THEIR WAY PARTWAY UP WHERE A SECTION OF THE CLIFF FACE HAD FALLEN BUT THE SUREFOOTED LITTLE GARRONS WERE ABLE TO PICK THEIR WAY THROUGH BEYOND THE WALLS PINCHED IN SHARPLY AND THE STREAM LED THEM TO THE FOOT OF A TALL TWISTING WATERFALL THE AIR WAS FULL OF MIST LIKE THE BREATH OF SOME VAST COLD BEAST THE TUMBLING WATERS SHONE SILVER IN THE MOONLIGHT JON LOOKED ABOUT IN DISMAY THERE IS NO WAY OUT HE AND QHORIN MIGHT BE ABLE TO CLIMB THE CLIFFS BUT NOT WITH THE HORSES HE DID NOT THINK THEY WOULD LAST LONG AFOOTQUICKLY NOW THE HALFHAND COMMANDED THE BIG MAN ON THE SMALL HORSE RODE OVER THE ICESLICK STONES RIGHT INTO THE CURTAIN OF WATER AND VANISHED WHEN HE DID NOT REAPPEAR JON PUT HIS HEELS INTO HIS HORSE AND WENT AFTER HIS GARRON DID HIS BEST TO SHY AWAY THE FALLING WATER SLAPPED AT THEM WITH FROZEN FISTS AND THE SHOCK OF THE COLD SEEMED TO STOP JONS BREATHTHEN HE WAS THROUGH DRENCHED AND SHIVERING BUT THROUGHTHE CLEFT IN THE ROCK WAS BARELY LARGE ENOUGH FOR MAN AND HORSE TO PASS BUT BEYOND THE WALLS OPENED UP AND THE FLOOR TURNED TO SOFT SAND JON COULD FEEL THE SPRAY FREEZING IN HIS BEARD GHOST BURST THROUGH THE WATERFALL IN AN ANGRY RUSH SHOOK DROPLETS FROM HIS FUR SNIFFED AT THE DARKNESS SUSPICIOUSLY THEN LIFTED A LEG AGAINST ONE ROCKY WALL QHORIN HAD ALREADY DISMOUNTED JON DID THE SAME YOU KNEW THIS PLACE WAS HEREWHEN I WAS NO OLDER THAN YOU I HEARD A BROTHER TELL HOW HE FOLLOWED A SHADOWCAT THROUGH THESE FALLS HE UNSADDLED HIS HORSE REMOVED HER BIT AND BRIDLE AND RAN HIS FINGERS THROUGH HER SHAGGY MANE THERE IS A WAY THROUGH THE HEART OF THE MOUNTAIN COME DAWN IF THEY HAVE NOT FOUND US WE WILL PRESS ON THE FIRST WATCH IS MINE BROTHER QHORIN SEATED HIMSELF ON THE SAND HIS BACK TO A WALL NO MORE THAN A VAGUE BLACK SHADOW IN THE GLOOM OF THE CAVE OVER THE RUSH OF FALLING WATERS JON HEARD A SOFT SOUND OF STEEL ON LEATHER THAT COULD ONLY MEAN THAT THE HALFHAND HAD DRAWN HIS SWORDHE TOOK OFF HIS WET CLOAK BUT IT WAS TOO COLD AND DAMP HERE TO STRIP DOWN ANY FURTHER GHOST STRETCHED OUT BESIDE HIM AND LICKED HIS GLOVE BEFORE CURLING UP TO SLEEP JON WAS GRATEFUL FOR HIS WARMTH HE WONDERED IF THE FIRE WAS STILL BURNING OUTSIDE OR IF IT HAD GONE OUT BY NOW IF THE WALL SHOULD EVER FALL ALL THE FIRES WILL GO OUT THE MOON SHONE THROUGH THE CURTAIN OF FALLING WATER TO LAY A SHIMMERING PALE STRIPE ACROSS THE SAND BUT AFTER A TIME THAT TOO FADED AND WENT DARKSLEEP CAME AT LAST AND WITH IT NIGHTMARES HE DREAMED OF BURNING CASTLES AND DEAD MEN RISING UNQUIET FROM THEIR GRAVES IT WAS STILL DARK WHEN QHORIN WOKE HIM WHILE THE HALFHAND SLEPT JON SAT WITH HIS BACK TO THE CAVE WALL LISTENING TO THE WATER AND WAITING FOR THE DAWNAT BREAK OF DAY THEY EACH CHEWED A HALFFROZEN STRIP OF HORSEMEAT THEN SADDLED THEIR GARRONS ONCE AGAIN AND FASTENED THEIR BLACK CLOAKS AROUND THEIR SHOULDERS DURING HIS WATCH THE HALFHAND HAD MADE A HALFDOZEN TORCHES SOAKING BUNDLES OF DRY MOSS WITH THE OIL HE CARRIED IN HIS SADDLEBAG HE LIT THE FIRST ONE NOW AND LED THE WAY DOWN INTO THE DARK HOLDING THE PALE FLAME UP BEFORE HIM JON FOLLOWED WITH THE HORSES THE STONY PATH TWISTED AND TURNED FIRST DOWN THEN UP THEN DOWN MORE STEEPLY IN SPOTS IT GREW SO NARROW IT WAS HARD TO CONVINCE THE GARRONS THEY COULD SQUEEZE THROUGH BY THE TIME WE COME OUT WE WILL HAVE LOST THEM HE TOLD HIMSELF AS THEY WENT NOT EVEN AN EAGLE CAN SEE THROUGH SOLID STONE WE WILL HAVE LOST THEM AND WE WILL RIDE HARD FOR THE FIST AND TELL THE OLD BEAR ALL WE KNOWBUT WHEN THEY EMERGED BACK INTO THE LIGHT LONG HOURS LATER THE EAGLE WAS WAITING FOR THEM PERCHED ON A DEAD TREE A HUNDRED FEET UP THE SLOPE GHOST WENT BOUNDING UP THE ROCKS AFTER IT BUT THE BIRD FLAPPED ITS WINGS AND TOOK TO THE AIRQHORINS
