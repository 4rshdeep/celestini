THOUSANDS OF YEARS PAST ALL THAT REMAINED WERE THREE BARE AND BARREN ISLANDS AND A DOZEN TOWERING STACKS OF ROCK THAT ROSE FROM THE WATER LIKE THE PILLARS OF SOME SEA GODS TEMPLE WHILE THE ANGRY WAVES
 FOAMED AND CRASHED AMONG THEMDREAR DARK FORBIDDING PYKE STOOD ATOP THOSE ISLANDS AND PILLARS ALMOST A PART OF THEM ITS CURTAIN WALL CLOSING OFF THE HEADLAND AROUND THE FOOT OF THE GREAT STONE BRIDGE
